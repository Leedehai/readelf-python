# readelf-python

Python tool to read ELF format, more hackable than GNU's readelf 

Originated from my pull request to @detailyang's [readelf](https://github.com/detailyang/readelf). But I figured it's even nicer to have one standalone Python file without the packages.

I may make further customizations to this file so I might as well create (instead of fork) this repo. My forked repo is [here](https://github.com/Leedehai/readelf).
